#   what is lighttpd :
    lighttpd is an open-source web server optimized for speed-critical environments while remaining standards-compliant, secure and flexible

# what is a web server : 
    to answer this question we first need to know what is a web page, it is a collection of raw materials ranging from texts to images to databases 
    all setting somewhere in the internet 
    a web server is a software that run on that same computer, when u ask for that page the webserver put all the raw materials together and give you 
    a ready web page.

#   example :
    when we search for our localhost ip 
        request -> web server -> render the page in your browser
    the most commun ones are APACHE and NGINIX they are very simple and most people are using it

#   wordpress:
    is a countent Management system meaning it's an app that help us create and orgnaize websites without direct coding
    dealing only with countent

other reasons to use a web server is that wordpress is a web based app that need an envirenement to be based on so when wordpress make a request
the web server need to fulffil it.

#   80 port to hudle HTTP requests

lightpd will answer our requests from 80 port from our localhost 
it will use the recources stored in the linux folder (because of this we will install wordpress inside this recources)
    there is a PHP communication between wordpress and lighttpd to see if thee php modules are installed and ready
of course this php module inside our lighttpd need a database witch is MariaDB in our case (to send sql requests to update the content precisely)

#   ps : MariaDB is also a server (databasee management system)
    it is an organized collection of information, a lot of times it goes into tabes witch called databases to be studied 
    like excel | unlike databases witch is optimized for an efficient data accesses...
as it is very broad database management system we onlt interested in usinge wordpress database

#   Letâ€™s take a moment and see how the PHP code in WordPress works with HTML first
    First, someone types in your web address in their browser, or they click on a link.
    This sends a request to your web hosting server.
    Your server then sends the HTML code over the Internet back to their browser.
    Their browser takes that HTML code and translates it into a web page

#   installing Lighttpd
    sudo apt install lighttpd -y
1- Start & Enable Lighttpd Service
    sudo systemctl start lighttpd
2-To check the status:
    systemctl status lighttpd


#   installing mariadb:
    #first i checked the system for MariaDB if it is available or not :
        systemctl status mariadb

    #installation of it :
            apt install mariadb-server

    #start interactive script to remove insecure default settings and to make the process auto
            sudo mysql_secure_installation
        Enter current password for root (enter for none): #Just press Enter (do not confuse database root with system root)
            Set root password? [Y/n] n
            Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
            Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
            Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
            Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
   
    #Log in to the MariaDB console
        sudo mariadb
            MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE aelkhali;
    
    # Create new database user and grant them full privileges on the newly-created database
        MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL ON aelkhali.* TO 'abdo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'abdo4321' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    
    #Flush the privileges
        MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    
    #Exit the MariaDB shell
        MariaDB [(none)]> exit
    
    # Verify whether database user was successfully created by logging in to the MariaDB
        mariadb -u <username-2> -p
        Enter password: <password-2>
    
    # Confirm whether database user has access to the database via SHOW DATABASES;.
        MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW DATABASES;
