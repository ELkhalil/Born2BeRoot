uname -a = it will give me everything i need to know about my architecture 
lscpu = it will give us informations about our CPU and i will search to find the CPU and awk on it

#	phyaical CPUs:
	to find physical CPU i need to cat a file inside my proc folder as it list every processor
	cd /proc/ cat cpuinfo
		and grep thee processor

#	finding the current available RAM:
	i need to find the available memory and it's utilization rate 
		used / free will give us the current available ram and it's utilization

#	finding the current available memory:
	pay attention here we are looking for the disk memory
	for that we use a command called : df -h (-h here mean human readable data)
		for more informations : https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/vps/how-to-check-and-manage-disk-space-via-terminal
	the -l to list only local files as mentioned in the --help
		df -hl
		size in here : i devided it by 1024 to get the size in GB

#	finding the CPU Utilization 
	we use the command top
	You can see Linux CPU utilization under CPU statistics
	when we run this command the output is devided into two sections 
	first section : contain the summury statistics of thee process
	second section : contains the list of the runing processors
	navigate and give the load

#	Whether LVM is active or not:
	i need the lsblk that list my partitions in details
	after runing it i will grep for lvm and minimize the output to only 1 line
	afteer that i am goig to use 

#	finding the active connections:
The Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP protocol for short, is a standard for exchanging data between different devices in a computer network
	there is a command called netstat but i am going to use an alternative here witch give me the same output
	ss -s (-s option for the summury)

#	The number of users using the server.:
	i used the who command that lists the users on my server and counted the lines

# the IPv4 address of your server 
	to find the ip address u only have to see the hostname -i

#	to find the mac address :
	i will use the ip addr command to find it and use the tail -5 and print only the MAC address

#	â€¢ The number of commands executed with the sudo program:
	on newer systems a command that hundle this is journalctl 

####### My final script : 
#!/bin/bash
