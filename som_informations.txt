1 - first of all what is virtualisation : 
---------------------------------------------
    Virtualization is the creation of a virtual -- rather than actual -- version of something, such as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network resources.
    Virtualization uses software that simulates hardware functionality to create a virtual system. This practice allows IT organizations to operate multiple operating systems,
    more than one virtual system and various applications on a single server. The benefits of virtualization include greater efficiencies and economies of scale.

2-How virtualization works
---------------------------------------------
    Virtualization describes a technology in which an application, guest OS or data storage is abstracted away from the true underlying hardware or software.
    A key use of virtualization technology is server virtualization, which uses a software layer -- called a hypervisor</a -- to emulate the underlying hardware.
    This often includes the CPU's memory, input/output (I/O) and network traffic.

3-How Virtualization made :
---------------------------------------------
    it is made based on a software callled the virtual machine monitor (VMM) or sum call it the virtualizer and the technical name of it is : HYPERVIZRO
    * what is a hypervisor : 
        hypervisor (also known as a virtual machine monitor, VMM, or virtualizer) is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.
        A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine.
    The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems.
    Unlike an emulator, the guest executes most instructions on the native hardware. (REMEMBER IT IS USING THE HARDWARE DIRECTLY)

4- what are the preveliged of this hypervisor :
---------------------------------------------
    Hypervisor - a program whose purpose is control and multiplexing of hardware for other kernels.
    Typically runs at an even higeher privileged level than a kernel, which was invented for this purpose.
    Allows sharing a single hardware between multiple operating systems or instances there.

5- what are the types of hypervisor : 
---------------------------------------------
it is classified of two important types : 

    * type-1 : native or bare-metal hypervisors
        These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems. For this reason,
        they are sometimes called bare-metal hypervisors. The first hypervisors, which IBM developed in the 1960s, were native hypervisors.[5]
        These included the test software SIMMON and the CP/CMS operating system, the predecessor of IBM z/VM.
    * type-2 : or hosted hypervisors
         These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system (OS) just as other computer programs do.
         A virtual machine monitor runs as a process on the host.
         Type-2 hypervisors abstract guest operating systems from the host operating system.

***  what is a DEBIAN : 
---------------------------------------------
    it is the oldest operating system based on the linux kernel .it it the father of a lot of distrubitions it has so many that builted based on it.
    The combination of Debian's philosophy and methodology and the GNU tools, the Linux kernel, and other important free software, form a unique software distribution called Debian GNU/Linux.
    why exactly debian : The feature that most distinguishes Debian from other Linux distributions is its package management system
                         These tools give the administrator of a Debian system complete control over the packages installed on that system,
                         including the ability to install a single package or automatically update the entire operating system
                         Individual packages can also be protected from being updated. You can even tell the package management system about software you have compiled yourself and what dependencies it fulfills.
    1.4. What is the Debian Installer: 
        Debian Installer, also known as “d-i”, is the software system to install a basic working Debian system.
        A wide range of hardware such as embedded devices, laptops, desktops and server machines is supported and a large set of free software for many purposes is offered.
        

6- what is a CentOS : 
---------------------------------------------
    it is also a linux distrubition.

==> why debian and not CentOS :
---------------------------------------------
the debia is favotable because it hase a lot of packages not like CentOS
CentOS takes so long in their versions realeas and sometimes many software froze and u have to wait so long fot it to support it 
it is very difficulte to do an update locally anlike debian witch is completely easy to do an update

7- what is AppArmor :
---------------------------------------------
    it is a Mandatory Access Control framework. When enabled, AppArmor confines programs according to a set of rules that specify what files a given program can access.
    This proactive approach helps protect the system against both known and unknown vulnerabilities.
    * what is Access Control framework : 
        Access control is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources...

8 - what is LVM :
---------------------------------------------
    (LVM) is a Logical Volume Manager for the Linux operating system.
       Logical volume management provides a higher-level view of the disk storage on a computer system than the traditional view of disks and partitions.
       This gives the system administrator much more flexibility in allocating storage to applications and users.
       Storage volumes created under the control of the logical volume manager can be resized and moved around almost at will.

9 - Encrypted LVM
---------------------------------------------
    When formatting a LVM volume, you can choose between encrypted LVM or not encrypted LVM. To protect the confidentiality of your valuable data,
    for instance in the event of the loss or theft of your computer or storage, such as volume, solid state disk, or hard drive,
    when formatting a LVM volume it is suggested to consider formatting it using the encrypted LVM option.
    <!> If you choose the encrypted LVM option, it is suggested to consider creating backup passwords.
    So that recovery is quick and easy :) Otherwise it the event that somehow your password is not working, you risk permanently losing all your valuable data.
    It is surprisingly frequent that people lose all their data because somehow their password is no longer working, and they did not created backup passwords.
    Encrypted LVM is very strong, so if somehow you locked yourself out, unless you have backup passwords it is likely that you would be permanently locked out :(

10 - what is SELinux :
---------------------------------------------
    Security-Enhanced Linux is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including
    mandatory access controls. SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions

10 - what is lsblk command :
---------------------------------------------
    Lsblk is used to display details about block devices and these block devices(Except ram disk) are basically those files that represent devices connected to the pc.
    It queries /sys virtual file system and udev db to obtain information that it displays. And it basically displays output in a tree-like structure.
    This command comes pre-installed with the util-Linux package. 

    * installing "lsblk"
        $sudo apt-get install util-linux

11 - what is an operating system :
---------------------------------------------
    An operating system consists of various fundamental programs which are needed by your computer so that it can communicate and receive instructions from users;
    read and write data to hard disks, tapes, and printers; control the use of memory; and run other software. The most important part of an operating system is the kernel.
    In a GNU/Linux system, Linux is the kernel component. The rest of the system consists of other programs, many of which were written by or for the GNU Project.
    Because the Linux kernel alone does not form a working operating system, we prefer to use the term “GNU/Linux” to refer to systems that many people casually refer to as “Linux”.

what is aptitude and apt ?
---------------------------------------------
Aptitude and apt-get are two of the popular tools which handle package management. Both are capable of handling all kinds of activities on packages including installation,
removal, search etc. But still there are differences between both the tools which make users prefer one over the other.
What are those differences that make these two tools to be considered separately is the scope of this article.

What is Apt ?
---------------------------------------------
Apt or Advanced Packaging Tool is a free and open source software which gracefully handles software installation and removal.
Initially it was designed for Debian’s .deb packages but it has been made compatible with RPM Package Manager.
Apt is whole command line with no GUI. Whenever invoked from command line along with specifying the name of package to be installed,
it finds that package in configured list of sources specified in ‘/etc/apt/sources.list’ along with the list of dependencies for that package
and sorts them and automatically installs them along with the current package thus letting user not to worry of installing dependencies.
It is highly flexible allowing User to control various configurations easily, like: adding any new source to search for packages,
apt-pinning i.e. marking any package unavailable during system up-gradation thus making its current version be its final version installed,
“smart” upgrade i.e. upgrading most important packages and leaving the least important ones.

What is Aptitude? :
---------------------------------------------
Aptitude is front-end to advanced packaging tool which adds a user interface to the functionality,
thus allowing a user to interactively search for a package and install or remove it. Initially created for Debain,
Aptitude extends its functionality to RPM based distributions as well.

UFW :
---------------------------------------------
    Uncomplicated Firewall 
    Uncomplicated Firewall is a program for managing a netfilter firewall designed to be easy to use. It uses a command-line interface consisting of a 
    small number of simple commands, and uses iptables for configuration. UFW is available by default in all Ubuntu installations since 8.04 LTS.

to ckeck the linux distribution => uname -r

check if something is installed we see the dpkg -l | grep sudo

host name : aelkhali42
    root ps : 123456789

to check the hostname : hostname
    to change it : nabvigate to the etc folder and change it inside the host file

1- install and configure sudo following strict rules
navigate to the sudoers (etc/sudoers) file and change the rules there

2- creating a group called user42: 
    addgroup user42
check the group by cating it using cat /etc/group | grep user42
    now i add a user called aelkhali to the group by 
        adduser aelkhali user42
    after that i add the user to the sudo group
        adduser aelkhali sudo
    check if group is added to sudo using 
        getent group sudo

Defaults  badpass_message="Password is wrong, please try again"  #try to set a message of your own

a useful command to list all the user inside ur linux : compgen -u
to change the hostname : 
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname fortknox

cron
Setting Up a cron Job
Configure cron as root via sudo crontab -u root -e.

$ sudo crontab -u root -e
To schedule a shell script to run every 10 minutes, replace below line

23 # m h  dom mon dow   command
with:

23 */10 * * * * sh /path/to/script
Check root's scheduled cron jobs via sudo crontab -u root -l.

$ sudo crontab -u root -l
